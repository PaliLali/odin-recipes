        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I used chocolate to make a screaming ghost face design on these Halloween-themed ice cream cookie sandwiches, just so I could do a play on words.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 large <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/10813/best-chocolate-chip-cookies/">chocolate chip cookies</a></li>
        <li>3 tablespoons melted dark chocolate</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons melted white chocolate</li>
        <li>Â½ cup vanilla ice cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cover the flat side of 4 cookies with melted dark chocolate; tap the cookies lightly to smooth out the chocolate.</li>
        <li>While still wet, use a piping bag or spoon to make a ghost shape with the white chocolate; tap lightly once more to smooth as needed. More white designs can be added to the dark chocolate background if desired.</li>
        <li>Use melted dark chocolate to make the eyes and screaming mouth; tap or shake once more to even and smooth out.</li>
        <li>Let chocolate cool until hard and dry to the touch, at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Scoop ice cream on 4 remaining cookies, and cover with the tops. Carefully press to flatten, and transfer to a freezer to freeze thoroughly before serving.</li>
    </ol>
